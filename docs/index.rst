Counterpart: Object Matching for PHP
====================================

Counter part is a *matching* framework for PHP and is used to compare values in
an object oriented way.

Some example use cases:

#. A testing framework could use Counterpart's matchers and ``Assert`` class for
   assertions.
#. A mock object library could use Counterpart to match argument expectations.
#. A validation library could use Counterpart to check that values match
   expectations.
